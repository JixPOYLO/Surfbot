Surfbot called Surfjix:

I did this project solo. 
I wanted to do a chatbot about one of my passion : surf !

I made contact with a surf API provider, we normally have to pay for their service but I reached them and they nicely 
answered to me and proposed to let me access to the info of 2 surf spots of their Database (instead of all the spots worldwide) 

Then I chose my two favorite surfspots in basque country (south of France) and they provided me the API key for those !

Therefore, I developed my bot with those two surfspots as examples.
Their names are "Bidart" and "Parlementia". 

The purpose of my bot is to tell me the actual surf conditions and give me advices
In fact, by calling the API and then doing an analysis of the data returned, i programmed
some tips and answers for the bot concerning a surf session 
It can be for the height of the waves and their period, the wind, the temperature of the sea
And then the bot give advices about the equipment with the different kind of boards for that 
surf session, the wet suit i should wear according to the sea temperature, ..

I deployed my Surfjix bot on Facebook Messenger and therefore you can watch the demo in the video. 

I still write here the answerable questions according to the data callected by the API call:
-How are the waves in Parlementia?
-How is the wind in Bidart?
-Which board for that spot?
-Which wet suit for Parlementia?
-What is the current mood in that spot?
-Which equipment for Bidart?


I hope you and your family are fine during this weird period.
Thank you very much for that course !
